#
# Proves the adaptive worker pool PARKS idle workers in operation (not just in
# a unit test), with a with/without control -- the property most often skipped:
#
#   cap=on  under --cpus=$CPUS -> burns ~only the burst's CPU, then parks while
#                                 idle. NOT meaningfully CPU-throttled by the
#                                 cgroup, because parked workers consume nothing.
#   cap=off under --cpus=$CPUS -> the control: over-subscribed OS threads
#                                 busy-spin on an empty queue, pegging the whole
#                                 cgroup CPU quota for the full window and
#                                 getting THROTTLED (throttled_usec > 0). It
#                                 burns many times the CPU-seconds of cap=on.
#                                 If cap=off did not, the test proves nothing.
#
# BLACK BOX: asserts on the CPU-seconds the process actually burned (from
# /proc/self/stat) and the cgroup's throttled_usec -- NOT on scalo internals.
#
# Usage:  scripts/operational-cpu-test.sh [CPUS] [IDLE_MS]
#   CPUS     docker --cpus value             (default 0.5)
#   IDLE_MS  idle window after the burst (ms) (default 6000)
#
# Requires docker. Exit 0 = both legs pass.
