scalo is the embedded, self-regulating runtime for data-plane services.
Opinionated about correctness -- backpressure, memory safety and the probe
trinity are on by default. Unopinionated about your domain -- no web
framework, no ORM, no enforced transport. Drop it in; it works out of the box.

Same batteries, idiomatic in each language: `cargo add scalo` (scalo-rs) /
`pip install scalo` (scalo-py).

Not a framework you assemble from twenty crates and 8 weeks of munging. Built
as the foundation for PB/hr data services.

This module exists because of this --
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE9W9Ghe4Jk> -- but for the backend. And of
course, no microservices.

## Quick Start

```toml
[dependencies]
scalo = "2"
```

Default features: `config`, `logger`. Add the others you want explicitly.

```rust
use scalo::{config, logger, env};

fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let environment = env::Environment::detect();
    logger::setup_default()?;
    config::setup(config::ConfigOptions {
        env_prefix: "MYAPP".into(),
        ..Default::default()
    })?;

    tracing::info!("Running in {environment:?}");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Native System Dependencies

This crate dynamically links against system C libraries for several features.
**Both build hosts and deployment targets need the appropriate packages.**

### Build Host (CI / Development)

| Feature | Crate | Build Package | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------|
| `transport-kafka` | `rdkafka-sys` | `librdkafka-dev` (>= 2.12.1) | Requires [Confluent APT repo](https://packages.confluent.io/clients/deb) — Ubuntu's default is too old |
| `directory-config-git` | `libgit2-sys` | `libgit2-dev`, `libssh2-1-dev` | System lib avoids vendored C build |
| `spool`, `tiered-sink` | `zstd-sys` | `libzstd-dev` | System lib avoids vendored C build |
| (transitive) | `libz-sys` | `zlib1g-dev` | Used by multiple deps |
| (transitive) | `openssl-sys` | `libssl-dev` | Dynamic linking via pkg-config |
| `secrets-aws` | `aws-lc-sys` | — | C/C++ compiled from source (no system lib available); ~20–30s first build, cached by sccache |

For `librdkafka-dev` >= 2.12.1, add the Confluent APT repo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://packages.confluent.io/clients/deb/archive.key \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/confluent-clients.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/confluent-clients.gpg] \
  https://packages.confluent.io/clients/deb noble main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/confluent-clients.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y librdkafka-dev libssl-dev libsasl2-dev pkg-config
```

### Deployment Host (Runtime)

The compiled binary links against `.so` files at runtime. Install the
**runtime** packages (not `-dev`) on deployment hosts or in Docker images.

| Feature | Runtime Package | Shared Object |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `transport-kafka` | `librdkafka1` (from Confluent repo) | `librdkafka.so.1` |
| `directory-config-git` | `libgit2-1.7` (or matching version) | `libgit2.so` |
| `spool`, `tiered-sink` | `libzstd1` | `libzstd.so.1` |
| (transitive) | `zlib1g` | `libz.so.1` |
| (transitive) | `libssl3` | `libssl.so.3` |

Only install what you use. Check the features your binary enables to
determine which runtime packages are needed.

### Docker Example

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM rust:1 AS builder
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    pkg-config libssl-dev librdkafka-dev libgit2-dev libzstd-dev
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

# Runtime stage
FROM ubuntu:24.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    librdkafka1 libssl3 libgit2-1.7 libzstd1 ca-certificates \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/myapp /usr/local/bin/
```

For `librdkafka1`, add the Confluent APT repo to both build and runtime stages.

## Health Check Endpoints — The Probe Trinity

For services deployed to Kubernetes, the `http-server` feature provides
the three K8s probe types:

| Probe | Path | Checks | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Startup | `/healthz/startup` | Init complete | K8s waits, then restarts |
| Liveness | `/healthz/live` | Process not deadlocked | Restart pod |
| Readiness | `/healthz/ready` | Deps healthy + ready flag set | Stop routing traffic |

Liveness MUST NEVER check downstream dependencies (a DB outage shouldn't
restart your replicas). Readiness checks dependencies AND requires an
explicit `set_ready()` call — cleared during graceful shutdown.

## Self-regulation (default vertical scaling)

A scalo data-plane app regulates its own intake. Sized for steady state, a
pod slows down or speeds up WITHIN itself first -- the default, fast, local
response to a burst, a stalled upstream, or a transform that balloons memory.
Only when that vertical headroom is exhausted does it escalate to horizontal
scale (KEDA adding pods), driven by the same pressure signal. Memory is the
hard, never-OOM authority; CPU is left to the kernel scheduler (CFS), which
the byte-budget loop reads through longer process times. It is ON by default
and opt-out via `self_regulation.enabled = false`. See
[docs/SELF-REGULATION.md](docs/SELF-REGULATION.md).
