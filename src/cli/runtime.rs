// Project:   scalo
// File:      src/cli/runtime.rs
// Purpose:   ServiceRuntime -- pre-built infrastructure for DFE service apps
// Language:  Rust
//
// License:   Apache-2.0
// Copyright: (c) 2026 HYPERI PTY LIMITED

//! Pre-built service infrastructure for DFE pipeline applications.
//!
//! [`ServiceRuntime`] is created by [`super::run_app`] before calling
//! [`ServiceApp::run_service`]. Apps receive it fully wired -- eliminates
//! ~50 lines of identical boilerplate per DFE app.
//!
//! ## What's included (always)
//!
//! - [`MetricsManager`] -- started, serving `/metrics`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`
//! - [`ServiceMetrics`] -- platform `dfe_*` metrics registered
//! - [`MemoryGuard`] -- cgroup-aware, auto-detected from env prefix
//! - [`CancellationToken`] -- signal handler installed with K8s pre-stop delay
//! - [`RuntimeContext`] -- K8s/Docker/BareMetal metadata
//!
//! ## What's included (when features enabled)
//!
//! - [`AdaptiveWorkerPool`] -- rayon + tokio hybrid (`worker` feature)
//! - [`ScalingPressure`] -- KEDA signals (`scaling` feature)
//!
//! ## What stays app-specific
//!
//! - Readiness check criteria (each app defines "ready" differently)
//! - Config hot-reload (optional, app-specific reload logic)
//! - Pipeline creation (100% domain-specific)
//! - DLQ setup (varies per app)
//! - App-specific metric groups (ConsumerMetrics, BufferMetrics, etc.)
