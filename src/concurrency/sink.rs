// Purpose:   BackgroundSink -- generic fire-and-forget durable sink
// Language:  Rust
//
// License:   Apache-2.0
// Copyright: (c) 2026 HYPERI PTY LIMITED

//! Generic fire-and-forget durable sink built on bounded `mpsc` +
//! background actor. Consumer hot path is sync-shaped and never blocks
//! the tokio runtime -- `try_push` is ~100 ns push to an mpsc queue.
//!
//! See the `concurrency` module documentation for the design
//! rationale and canonical usage of these three primitives.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! - [`BackgroundSink::try_push`] returns immediately. ~100 ns when the
//!   queue has space; `Err(SinkError::Overflow)` if full (Drop mode).
//! - [`BackgroundSink::push_blocking`] is `async` and awaits queue
//!   space. Use when the caller can yield.
//! - [`BackgroundSink::flush`] is `async` and resolves only after every
//!   message accepted before this call is durably written by the drain.
//!   It returns `Err` if any batch written since the previous flush
//!   failed, whether that write was size-, tick- or barrier-triggered.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! ```text
//! consumer (many) --try_push--> mpsc bounded --> actor task --> drain.write_batch
//! ```
//!
//! The actor batches messages by size (`batch_size`) or interval
//! (`flush_interval`), whichever fires first, then hands the batch to
//! the drain. Drain implementations supply backend-specific async I/O.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! When the [`tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`] is cancelled, the
//! actor drains everything currently in the queue, writes a final
//! batch, calls `drain.close()`, and exits. Use the returned
//! [`BackgroundSinkHandle::join`] to await graceful drain.
