//! Error types for [`crate::concurrency`] primitives.
//!
//! Three concrete error enums, one per primitive:
//! [`SinkError`] for `BackgroundSink`, [`TickError`] for `PeriodicWorker`,
//! [`ActorError`] for `ActorHandle`. Plus [`DrainError`] for `SinkDrain`
//! implementations to report backend failures back to the actor.
