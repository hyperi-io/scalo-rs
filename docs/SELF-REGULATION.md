# Self-regulation

The data plane regulates itself. A scalo app sized for steady state does
not fall over when a burst arrives, an upstream stalls, or a transform
balloons memory -- the pipeline slows its own intake, lets the in-flight
work drain, and speeds back up once the pressure clears. This happens
automatically; an app wires nothing.

Self-regulation is **ON by default**. To turn it off (byte-identical to the
pre-governor data path), set one cascade key:

```yaml
self_regulation:
  enabled: false
```

When `enabled = false` the runtime constructs NOTHING -- no pressure
governor, no inbound gate, no byte-budget controller. Every `Option` stays
`None` and the data path is the original whole-batch loop. There is no
half-on state.

See also [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md) (where the brake is applied and
why) and [KAFKA-PATH.md](KAFKA-PATH.md) (how the Kafka GET/PROCESS/SEND
batch sizes feed the loop). The code lives in `src/governor/`.

## Self-regulation: the default vertical-scaling principle

Self-regulation is how a scalo app scales VERTICALLY -- a single pod
adapting its OWN intake to its OWN resources. It is the DEFAULT and the
FIRST response to pressure, and it is distinct from (and complementary to)
HORIZONTAL scaling, where KEDA adds pods.

The doctrine, in one line: a pod sized for steady state regulates its own
intake FIRST -- it slows down or speeds up WITHIN the pod -- and only
escalates to horizontal scale (more pods) once its vertical headroom is
exhausted. Vertical is the fast, local, free response; horizontal is the
slow, global, capacity response. They are not alternatives. Vertical buys
time; horizontal adds capacity when the time runs out.

Memory is the hard, never-OOM authority on the vertical side. CPU is left to
CFS: under a CPU quota the Linux scheduler throttles the process, each batch
takes longer, and the AIMD byte-budget loop sees the longer process time and
shrinks the budget on its own. There is no separate CPU brake -- adding one
would double-count a signal CFS already handles (see "Why memory is HARD and
CPU is deliberately dropped" below).

Self-regulation is ON by default. Opt out with `self_regulation.enabled =
false`, which builds nothing on the vertical side; horizontal scaling via
`ScalingPressure` is unaffected.

### Vertical vs horizontal

| | Vertical (self-regulation) | Horizontal (KEDA) |
|---|---|---|
| Question | "Should this pod pull more work right now?" | "Do we need more pods?" |
| Mechanism | MemoryGuard + UnifiedPressure inbound gate + AIMD byte budget | ScalingPressure -> external-scaler signal -> KEDA |
| Lives in | This library, in-pod | This library's signal; KEDA acts on it |
| Scope | One pod, its own intake | The whole deployment, replica count |
| Timescale | Milliseconds | Seconds to minutes (pod start) |
| Cost | Free -- no new capacity | A new pod |
| Default | ON | Driven by the same pressure / lag signal |

The two compose rather than compete. The SAME pressure that brakes a pod's
intake also surfaces as consumer lag (Kafka) or queue depth, which is the
signal `ScalingPressure` feeds to KEDA. Braking intake on one pod buys time
for the in-flight buffer to drain; sustained pressure that the brake cannot
clear is exactly the condition that should add a replica. See the
`Pressure -> lag -> KEDA` section in [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md) and
[pipeline/SCALING.md](pipeline/SCALING.md) for the KEDA signal.

## The three brains

Self-regulation is three distinct controllers with three distinct jobs.
They are NOT interchangeable; each answers a different question.

| Brain | Question | Acts on | Source of truth? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MemoryGuard** | "Are we about to OOM?" | The HARD pressure signal | YES -- the never-OOM authority |
| **ScalingPressure** | "Do we need more pods?" | KEDA / external scaler signal | Pool sizing, not the data path |
| **UnifiedPressure** | "Should I pull more work right now?" | The inbound gate + byte budget | Derived from the sources above |

- **MemoryGuard** (`src/memory/`) is the source of truth. It tracks
  in-flight ingress bytes (and, when a heap source is wired, the true
  process heap -- see the `set_heap_source` entry in
  [MIGRATIONS.md](MIGRATIONS.md)). Its `pressure_ratio()` is fed into the
  governor as a **HARD** source: never weighted, never masked. A saturated
  soft signal can never lower the combined level below what memory demands.
  This is the never-OOM guarantee.
- **ScalingPressure** (`src/scaling/`) drives horizontal scaling. It emits
  the external-scaler signal KEDA reads to add or remove pods. It is a
  capacity lever, not a data-path lever -- it does not pause intake, it
  asks for more replicas. See [pipeline/SCALING.md](pipeline/SCALING.md).
- **UnifiedPressure** (`src/governor/source.rs`) combines the sources into
  ONE normalised level in `[0.0, 1.0]` under a hysteretic latch. It is what
  the inbound gate and the byte-budget controller both consult. It owns no
  signal of its own -- it is the seam that turns the brains' readings into
  a single pause/resume decision.

### Why memory is HARD and CPU is deliberately dropped

Memory is the only resource that kills the process. Run out of CPU and the
work merely runs slower; run out of memory and the kernel OOM-kills the pod
and in-flight data is lost. So memory is the HARD source -- the one signal
that always gets through.

CPU is deliberately NOT a pressure source:

- **CFS self-corrects.** Under a CPU quota the Linux scheduler throttles the
  process for us. A CPU-bound stage simply takes longer per batch; the
  byte-budget loop sees the longer process time and shrinks on its own. No
  separate CPU brake is needed -- adding one would double-count the same
  signal.
- **CPU saturation surfaces as lag, and lag is KEDA's job.** A pod that
  cannot keep up grows consumer lag; KEDA reads the lag and adds a replica.
  Horizontal scale is the right answer to "not enough CPU", not pausing
  intake on the one pod that is already maxed.

The seam is built to accept a CPU source LATER with **zero API change**.
`UnifiedPressure::add_source` takes any `PressureSource`; a future CPU
source would plug in as a SOFT, weighted source and every existing caller
of `level()` / `should_hold()` is untouched. The decision to drop CPU is a
default, not a wall.

### The memory signal: max, high, and PSI

The HARD memory source reads the container's own cgroup, not host `used/total`
(on a shared node the host figure is unrelated to this pod's limit). Three
cgroup v2 inputs, container-first:

- **`memory.max`** -- the hard ceiling. Cross it and the kernel OOM-kills the
  pod. Base pressure ratio is `memory.current / memory.max`.
- **`memory.high`** -- the soft throttle. The kernel reclaims hard and throttles
  allocations here, BEFORE the OOM-kill, so the signal takes the WORST of
  `current/max` and `current/high` -- shedding before the throttle's latency
  cliff, not just before the kill. The `MemoryGuard` likewise caps its
  admission limit at `memory.high` when that is below `max * headroom`.
- **`memory.pressure` (PSI `some avg10`)** -- the earliest signal: the fraction
  of the last 10s in which a task stalled on memory. Emitted as the
  `worker_pool_memory_psi_some` gauge for observability/alerting. NOT folded
  into the shed decision -- the actionable stall-percent is workload-specific
  and wants per-service calibration, not a guessed constant.

## How the loop works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MG["MemoryGuard.pressure_ratio()"] -->|HARD| UP["UnifiedPressure.level()"]
    UP --> IG["InboundGate<br/>(pause/resume the SOURCE)"]
    UP --> BB["ByteBudgetController<br/>(AIMD lever -> sub-block size)"]
```

- **InboundGate** (`src/governor/gate.rs`) turns the latch into EDGE events:
  `pause()` once on the rising edge, `resume()` once on the falling edge. It
  pauses the inbound SOURCE (stops pulling new work) -- never the outbound
  drain. See [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md) for why gating the drain
  deadlocks.
- **ByteBudgetController** (`src/governor/budget.rs`) is an AIMD
  (additive-increase / multiplicative-decrease) lever that sizes the inbound
  byte budget for a target utilisation `rho ~= 0.7`. Slack grows the budget
  additively; falling behind shrinks it multiplicatively; a memory HARD
  override shrinks IMMEDIATELY regardless of `rho`. See
  [KAFKA-PATH.md](KAFKA-PATH.md) for the full AIMD description and the
  PROCESS byte-budget's place among the three Kafka batch sizes.

The controller starts BIG (`start_bytes`) and lets the decrease loop find
the level -- a cold pipeline is never artificially throttled. While pressure
is LOW the budget sits at its big start value, so a received block becomes a
SINGLE sub-block with no per-record overhead: behaviour matches the
whole-batch loop. Near-zero cost off-pressure.

The governed driver (`BatchEngine::run_governed`) is the run path a
self-regulating app calls. It dispatches on whether the byte budget is wired:
budget present -> stream in sub-blocks sized to the current budget and fold
each block's `(bytes, process_time, ingest_interval)` into the AIMD loop;
budget absent (governor off) -> delegate verbatim to `run_workbatch`,
byte-identical to pre-governor behaviour. The streaming sub-block mechanics
live in [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md).

## Observe

Self-regulation is visible, not mysterious. When throttling happens you can
see it.

| Signal | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `self_regulation_inbound_paused` | gauge (0/1) | The inbound gate is currently holding (1) or open (0). Carries a `source` label (e.g. `kafka`, `http`) so two governed receivers on one pod are told apart |
| `self_regulation_inbound_pauses_total` | counter | Number of pause EDGES (rising transitions), not per-evaluate noise. Carries the same `source` label |
| `self_regulation_byte_budget` | gauge | Current AIMD byte budget (the inbound block-size lever) |
| `self_regulation_recv_block_bytes` | gauge | Actual bytes of the most recent received block (reality, against which the budget is the intent) |
| `self_regulation_pressure_ratio` | gauge | Combined `UnifiedPressure.level()` in `[0, 1]` |
| `self_regulation_kafka_gate_errors_total` | counter | Kafka pause/resume actuator failures, `op` label = `pause` or `resume`. A sustained non-zero rate means the brake is silently disabled for the Kafka source -- alert on it |

Because the gate fires each edge EXACTLY ONCE (`ObservingActuator` in
`src/governor/gate.rs`), the `self_regulation_inbound_paused` gauge and the
`self_regulation_inbound_pauses_total` counter track real transitions, not
per-evaluate noise. The gate also logs a brake-reason line on each edge:

```text
WARN  self-regulation: inbound PAUSED under pressure (memory/back-pressure brake)  source=kafka
INFO  self-regulation: inbound RESUMED, pressure cleared  source=kafka
```

A pause without a matching resume in the logs means the pressure has not
cleared -- check the memory guard and consumer lag.

---

## Tune

All tuning is via the `self_regulation` cascade section (7-layer cascade,
hot-reload, `/config` admin endpoint -- same as every other config section;
see [core-pillars/CONFIG.md](core-pillars/CONFIG.md)).

```yaml
self_regulation:
  enabled: true            # master switch (default true)
  profile: throughput      # throughput | balanced | low_latency -- sizes the AIMD envelope
  pause_above: 0.80        # arm the inbound hold when combined pressure reaches this
  resume_below: 0.65       # release the hold when pressure drops to this (must be < pause_above)
  target_rho: 0.7          # target utilisation for the byte-budget AIMD loop, in (0, 1)
  md_factor: 0.5           # multiplicative-decrease factor, in (0, 1)
```

- **`enabled`** -- the only knob most apps touch. `false` builds nothing.
- **`profile`** -- sizes the AIMD byte-budget envelope (start / ceiling /
  step / record cap). `throughput` starts big with a high ceiling;
  `low_latency` starts small so blocks stay small and bursty. It mirrors the
  Kafka `SelfRegulationProfile` names so one value reads the same regardless
  of transport.
- **`pause_above` / `resume_below`** -- the hysteresis band. The gap between
  them prevents flapping: the latch arms at `pause_above`, releases at
  `resume_below`, and holds its state in between. An inverted or non-finite
  band falls back to the defaults (`0.80` / `0.65`) with a warning rather
  than wedging the governor.
- **`target_rho`** -- how busy to keep the stage. Lower means more headroom
  (safer under bursts); higher means tighter packing (more efficient,
  riskier).
- **`md_factor`** -- how hard to brake when behind or under memory pressure.
  `0.5` halves the budget per decrease step.

Every default is set so an app that configures nothing gets a fully working,
default-ON governor. Bad knobs are sanitised, not fatal.

### Small / memory-tight pods

The default profile is `throughput`, which starts with a large byte budget
(start-big, back-off-on-pressure). That is the right call for a PB/day
ingest pod with headroom, but on a small or memory-tight pod it can spike
in the COLD-START WINDOW -- the very first block is sized to the start
budget before the AIMD loop or the memory-hard override has seen any
pressure to react to. The governor self-corrects after that first block
(the memory-hard override drops the budget the moment in-flight bytes climb
toward the limit), so this is a transient first-block spike, not a steady
state.

There is deliberately NO dedicated "small-pod" preset (YAGNI). For a
small/memory-tight pod, do one of:

- Set a lower start budget directly under `self_regulation` (cap the
  first-block size so the cold-start window cannot overshoot the pod's
  memory limit).
- Use the `balanced` or `low_latency` profile -- both start with a smaller
  byte-budget envelope, so the cold-start first block is correspondingly
  smaller.

Either way the memory-hard override remains the never-OOM backstop; the
profile/start-budget choice only governs how large that first pre-feedback
block is.

### cgroup OOM-kill operational test (release checklist)

The in-process logical never-OOM test asserts the governor's control loop
never lets in-flight bytes exceed the configured limit. It does NOT prove
the process survives a real OS-level cgroup OOM-killer under a hard
container memory limit. The real test -- a memory-limited container under
sustained load, asserting NO cgroup OOM-kill where an ungoverned pipeline
would be killed -- is a RELEASE-CHECKLIST / CI-harness item, run out of
process against a real cgroup. It is not covered by the in-process unit
tests and must be exercised separately before a release.
