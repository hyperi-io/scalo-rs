# scalo docs

Shared Rust library for HyperI services. Wire three lines at startup and you
get config cascade, structured logs, Prometheus metrics, health probes, OTel
traces, graceful shutdown, K8s pre-stop, and deployment-artefact generation
for free. Add a `Transport`, a `TieredSink`, a `BatchEngine` and the same
deal extends: counters, span propagation, DLQ routing, backpressure, scaling
signals — all automatic.

This is the index. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
10,000-foot view of how the modules fit together, [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)
for a recipe walkthrough on building a DFE service, [AUTO-WIRING.md](AUTO-WIRING.md)
for the "you-get-this-for-free" model, and [FEATURE-FLAGS.md](FEATURE-FLAGS.md)
for how features cascade into one another.

## What you get for free

| Wire this at startup | And these come along | No need to |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| `config::setup(opts)` | 7-layer cascade, env-var nesting, `.env`, sensitive masking, hot-reload, `/config` admin endpoint, section registry | Wire figment, write a settings loader, build a reload watcher |
| `logger::setup_default()` | Structured tracing, JSON-in-container / human-on-TTY autodetect, RFC 3339 timestamps, sensitive-field masking, flooding helpers | Install a tracing subscriber, format JSON, pick a logger crate |
| `MetricsManager::new("app")` | Prometheus exporter, `/metrics` endpoint, process metrics, cardinality cap, `/metrics/manifest` catalogue | Stand up an exporter, wire a process collector, hand-roll a manifest |
| `ServiceRuntime::new(...)` | All of the above + memory guard + scaling pressure + worker pool + batch engine + shutdown token + K8s pre-stop delay + runtime context | Glue them together manually; six modules wire themselves |
| Any `Transport` impl | 3-tier filter engine, DLQ routing, per-direction/action metrics, W3C traceparent propagation | Add filters, wire DLQ, instrument send/recv |
| `TieredSink::new(...)` | Transport + disk-spillover spool + circuit breaker + retry + DLQ fallback + backpressure signal | Compose those primitives by hand |

That's the value proposition. Everything else in these docs is "and here's
how the pieces work".

  shipped.

- [superpowers/](superpowers/) — design specs and execution plans for in-flight work
- [MIGRATIONS.md](MIGRATIONS.md) — API surface changes by scalo version; consumer-rebuild playbook
