# Kafka path

One idea: a byte-budget envelope with a time bound, so a single config takes a
stage from "SME on a laptop" to hyperscale without re-tuning. Covered here: the
three batch sizes, the sizing profile, the librdkafka property names the code
uses (several differ from the Java client), the AIMD loop, wire compression,
static membership, the raw escape hatch, the partition-limited diagnostic.

Code: `src/transport/kafka/config.rs` (sizing surface),
`src/transport/kafka/mod.rs` (transport + diagnostic). See
[SELF-REGULATION.md](SELF-REGULATION.md) and [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md)
for the governor and brake over this path.

## The three batch sizes

THREE distinct batch sizes on the Kafka path; conflating them is the usual
tuning mistake. Each governs a different hop.

| # | Batch | Governs | Sized by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **GET** (consumer fetch) | How many bytes the broker hands the consumer per Fetch | `fetch.min.bytes` + `fetch.wait.max.ms` + `fetch.max.bytes` + `max.partition.fetch.bytes` |
| 2 | **PROCESS** (WorkBatch) | How much in-flight data the stage holds while processing | The AIMD byte budget (`src/governor/budget.rs`) -- the self-regulation lever |
| 3 | **SEND** (producer) | How many bytes the producer accumulates per MessageSet | `batch.size` + `linger.ms` |

- **GET** is broker-side accumulation: the broker waits up to
  `fetch.wait.max.ms` to fill `fetch.min.bytes` before responding. Bigger
  GET batches mean fewer round-trips and higher throughput, at the cost of
  latency when traffic is thin.
- **PROCESS** is the only one that self-regulates. It is the byte budget the
  governed driver uses to size sub-blocks (see
  [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md)). GET and SEND are static librdkafka
  knobs; PROCESS moves with pressure.
- **SEND** is producer-side accumulation, mirror of GET. `linger.ms` is the
  time bound; `batch.size` is the byte bound.

The poll-safety cap (`max_poll_records`) is a fourth, count-based limit. It
is NOT a librdkafka property -- there is no broker knob for it. It is a
client-side cap enforced by passing it as the `max` argument to
`recv()`, bounding how many records the WorkBatch layer receives per poll so
a tiny-record flood cannot blow the count even within the byte budget.

---

## Byte budget + time bound = one config, SME to hyperscale

The sizing knobs default to GENEROUS ceilings with a TIME bound. The ceiling
lets a busy topic fill large, efficient batches; the time bound
(`fetch.wait.max.ms` on GET, `linger.ms` on SEND) stops a quiet topic stalling
to fill it -- it returns whatever it has when the timer fires. The same
`profile: throughput` config that batches a PB/day firehose into 1 MiB fetches
also serves a trickle at low latency, because the time bound caps the wait
either way. One config, no re-tuning as volume grows.

On a small or memory-tight pod the generous `throughput` start budget can
overshoot in the cold-start window (the first block before the governor's
AIMD loop / memory-hard override reacts). Set a lower `self_regulation`
start budget or use the `balanced` / `low_latency` profile -- see the
small-pod guidance in [SELF-REGULATION.md](SELF-REGULATION.md).

---

## Profile + GET/SEND tuning table

`SelfRegulationProfile` (in `src/transport/kafka/config.rs`) sets opinionated
defaults for the byte envelope and latency. An explicit per-knob value wins
over the profile default; the raw sizing maps win over the named knobs; the
transport-level `kafka.librdkafka_overrides` wins over all of it (see the full
precedence below).

```yaml
kafka:
  sizing:
    profile: throughput      # throughput (default) | balanced | low_latency
    consumer:
      fetch_min_bytes: 2097152      # 2 MiB, overrides the profile default
    producer:
      compression_type: zstd        # opt into zstd for storage-bound topics
    consumer_librdkafka:
      fetch.wait.max.ms: "75"       # raw override -- wins over everything
    producer_librdkafka:
      linger.ms: "50"
```

The profile defaults, with the ACTUAL librdkafka property each maps to:

| Profile | GET `fetch.min.bytes` | GET `fetch.wait.max.ms` | GET `max.partition.fetch.bytes` | GET `fetch.max.bytes` | poll cap | SEND `batch.size` | SEND `linger.ms` | SEND codec | SEND `queue.buffering.max.kbytes` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `throughput` (default) | 1 MiB | 50 ms | 10 MiB | 100 MiB | 2000 | 128 KiB | 20 ms | lz4 | 64 MiB |
| `balanced` | 256 KiB | 25 ms | 5 MiB | 50 MiB | 1000 | 64 KiB | 5 ms | lz4 | 32 MiB |
| `low_latency` | 1 byte | 5 ms | 1 MiB | 10 MiB | 500 | 16 KiB | 0 ms | lz4 | 16 MiB |

### librdkafka property names -- mind the differences

librdkafka is NOT the Java Kafka client. Several property names differ, and
the code uses the librdkafka ones. Getting these wrong silently no-ops
(librdkafka ignores unknown keys).

| Intent | librdkafka (used here) | NOT (Java client) |
|---|---|---|
| Max broker wait to fill a fetch | `fetch.wait.max.ms` | `fetch.max.wait.ms` |
| Uniform sticky for null-key messages (KIP-794) | `sticky.partitioning.linger.ms` | `partitioner.ignore.keys` |
| Total producer queue byte budget | `queue.buffering.max.kbytes` (in KiB) | `buffer.memory` (in bytes) |
| Accumulation delay before send | `linger.ms` (alias `queue.buffering.max.ms`) | -- |
| Per-MessageSet byte ceiling | `batch.size` (bytes -- same name/unit as Java) | -- |

KIP-794 detail: `partitioner.ignore.keys` is a Java-client-only property and
does NOT exist in librdkafka. The librdkafka equivalent for uniform sticky
null-key distribution is to keep the default `consistent_random` partitioner
and set `sticky.partitioning.linger.ms` equal to the linger window, so
null-key batches stick to one partition until the batch is full, then rotate.
The sizing surface sets this to `linger_ms` automatically. It does NOT set
`partitioner` (keyed `RoutedSender` paths set their own).

`queue.buffering.max.kbytes` is in KiB -- the config struct stores the
producer buffer in bytes and divides by 1024 when it applies the property.

## The rho ~ 0.7 loop

The PROCESS byte budget is driven by an AIMD loop (full description in
[SELF-REGULATION.md](SELF-REGULATION.md) and `src/governor/budget.rs`). In
Kafka terms:

- `rho = EMA(process_time) / EMA(ingest_interval)` -- how much of the gap
  between fetches the stage spends processing.
- `rho < 0.7` (slack) -> additive-increase the budget: pull bigger blocks.
- `rho > 0.7` (behind) -> multiplicative-decrease: pull smaller blocks.
- memory HARD pressure -> multiplicative-decrease IMMEDIATELY, regardless of
  rho. Memory never waits for the rho loop.

Target `0.7` keeps the consumer ~70% busy with 30% headroom for a fetch burst.

---

## Wire compression

All profiles default the producer to `lz4` -- the best throughput/ratio
tradeoff for the hot path. Match the codec to the topic:

- **`lz4`** (default) -- fast, good ratio. Right for most transform /
  forwarding topics.
- **`zstd`** -- better ratio, higher CPU. Opt in for storage-bound topics
  (archiver, long-retention land/load) that can absorb the CPU to save disk
  and network.

Set per stage via `kafka.sizing.producer.compression_type`. The consumer
decompresses transparently regardless of producer codec.

---

## KIP / Kafka 4.0 notes

- **KIP-429 (cooperative rebalancing)** -- the consumer profiles set
  `partition.assignment.strategy = cooperative-sticky` to avoid
  stop-the-world rebalances. Combined with partition-pause backpressure (see
  [BACKPRESSURE.md](BACKPRESSURE.md)), a paused consumer stays IN the group
  rather than triggering a rebalance.
- **KIP-794 (uniform sticky partitioner)** -- handled via
  `sticky.partitioning.linger.ms` as above, since librdkafka lacks the Java
  `partitioner.ignore.keys`.
- **KIP-848 (new consumer group protocol)** and **Kafka 4.0** -- the sizing
  surface is property-name based and forward-compatible: as librdkafka adds
  support, the raw escape hatch can set the new properties without a scalo
  change. Share groups (below) are the 4.0 answer to partition-limited
  scaling.

---

## Static membership (KIP-345) -- opt-in

`kafka.group_instance_id` (env `<PREFIX>_GROUP_INSTANCE_ID`) sets
`group.instance.id`. Default `None` -- dynamic membership. Set it to a STABLE,
UNIQUE-per-replica value (the K8s pod name from the downward API is the
canonical choice) and a member that restarts rejoins with its PRIOR partitions
WITHOUT a group-wide rebalance. That turns a rolling restart of a large
consumer fleet from dozens of stop-the-world rebalances into zero.

The value MUST be unique per replica -- two replicas sharing one
`group.instance.id` get fenced. An empty value is treated as unset.

---

## The raw escape hatch

The sizing surface is opinionated but never a cage. Two raw maps let an
operator set ANY librdkafka property:

```yaml
kafka:
  sizing:
    consumer_librdkafka:
      fetch.wait.max.ms: "75"
    producer_librdkafka:
      linger.ms: "50"
```

The sizing raw maps win over the profile defaults and the named knobs.
Full resolution precedence (lowest to highest):

1. `SelfRegulationProfile` defaults
2. Named knobs (`consumer.*` / `producer.*`)
3. Sizing raw maps (`consumer_librdkafka` / `producer_librdkafka`)
4. Transport-level `kafka.librdkafka_overrides` -- re-applied LAST, wins over
   the sizing surface too (it is the broad client-config override, not part of
   the sizing surface)

When a raw override touches a property the sizing governor depends on (the
fetch byte sizes, `enable.auto.commit`, the producer batch/linger/compression
keys), the code logs ONE warning per key so the operator knows the governor's
assumptions changed. An invalid key silently no-ops in librdkafka -- check
spelling.

The producer is built from a SEPARATE `ClientConfig`, not the consumer's:
consumer-only keys (`group.id`, `session.timeout.ms`, fetch sizes) would make
librdkafka ignore the producer sizing surface otherwise. The producer config
carries security + the producer sizing map; `kafka.librdkafka_overrides`
applies last to both halves.

## Partition-limited diagnostic

A Kafka consumer group cannot have more ACTIVELY-consuming members than the
topic has partitions -- extra members sit idle. So adding pods past the
partition count does nothing for throughput; the lag just keeps growing while
half the pods do nothing.

scalo DETECTS this and tells you. It does NOT fix it by mutating topology.
`KafkaTransport::check_partition_limited` (governor feature,
`src/transport/kafka/mod.rs`) reads:

- the member count scoped to THIS group (`fetch_group_list(Some(group_id))` --
  not every group on a shared cluster), defaulting to 1 on a transient read,
- the TOPIC's TOTAL partition count summed over subscribed topics (broker
  metadata -- NOT this member's assigned slice; the assignment count made the
  check fire whenever m^2 >= P, a false positive with headroom to spare),
- the current total lag,

then evaluates the pure `partition_limited(members, partitions, lag)` decision.
When limited it:

- sets the `kafka_partition_limited` gauge to `1.0` (else `0.0`),
- registers a `Degraded` entry on the health registry, and
- emits ONE rate-limited warning per cooldown window (deduped so a
  persistently-limited consumer does not spam the log).

It NEVER calls `createPartitions` -- no topology mutation. This is a
metadata round-trip, run periodically (e.g. once per refresh tick via
`spawn_partition_limited_tick`), not on the recv hot path.

The warning:

```text
WARN  kafka consumer group is partition-limited: members >= partitions with
      persistent lag -- extra consumers sit idle; the topic needs more
      partitions (diagnostic only, no topology change made)
      members=8 partitions=4 lag=120000
```

Resolution is an operator / topology decision, not something scalo should
do silently:

- **More partitions per pod** -- raise per-pod parallelism so each consumer
  drains its assigned partitions faster (the byte budget + worker pool
  already help here).
- **Share groups (KIP-932, Kafka 4.0)** -- let more consumers than partitions
  share a partition's records, breaking the one-member-per-partition ceiling.
- **Over-partition the topic** -- create the topic with more partitions than
  you expect to need, so scale-out has headroom. The cleanest fix, but a
  create-time decision.
